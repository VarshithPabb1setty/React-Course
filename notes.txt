** npm i -D parcel(command). What is "-D" in this?
installing package as Dev dependencies.

** What is difference between dev dependencies and dependencies?
Dev dependencies are the dependencies only in the development phase. where as dependecies are the dependencies after the production release. Here parcel bundler is a 
dependency for us only in the development phase.

** What is bundler?
It helps our code to be production ready.

** What is npm?
It manages the packages but it is not termed as node package manager.

** What does caret(^) or tilde(~) meant in package.json?
caret(^) is put to update minor version upgrades of the package by default.
tilde(~) is put to update major version upgrades of the package by default.
Note: It is preferred to use caret(^) because if there is any major update, the app starts breaking.

** What is package.json?
It is a configuration for npm. It keeps the track of packages and its versions.

** What is package-lock.json?
It keeps logs of every version update and exact version of that package or dependency installed.

** What is integrity in package-lock.json?
It is a hash. It is used to verify if the version deployed on production and version on the local machine is same.

** What are node_modules?
It fetches the code of package installed from the npm and put it in a separate folder. It is database of the dependencies.

** What are the other files apart from the package installed in node_modules folder?
Those are all the dependencies of that package. And those dependencies further have their own dependencies. So, when we do npm i package, everything is installed.
These are called as Transitive dependencies.

** Why should node_modules not go inside git?
Size of node_modules is huge and it is not necessary to put in git as it just has the code for packages and its dependencies. All the packages with their version
logs are already there in package and package-lock.json. So, once you do "npm i" the exact versions of the packages will be installed on any environment.

** What all should not be put in git?
Whatever you think can be regenarated, those are not expected to be put on git.

** What is npx?
When we want to execute a package, we use npx

** What does parcel do? and what does npx parcel index.html do?
Parcel is a bundler. In "npx parcel index.html", index.html is source. with the command parcel goes to the source file and build a development build for our app
and it host that development build on the localhost server. It also does HMR(Hot Module Replacement) - whenever we save our file the changes are imported into 
server right away. Parcel does this by using File Watcher Algorithm which is written in C++. Parcel gives you faster builds because it uses caching. 
Parcel also does Image Optimization. Parcel does minification of file at production build. It also does bundling. Parcel also compresses your file.
Parcel also does consistent hashing. Parcel does code splitting. Parcel does differential bundling(When we host an application. It should work on all browsers
and all versions of browser). Parcel does diagnostics. Parcel does Error Handling. Parcel also helps us to host on HTTPs server. Parcel uses Tree shaking algorithm(
If we have multiple functions in our files and we use only 4-5 functions of them, if will remove unused code)

** Why is installing react package better than pasting cdn links to import react in our app?
Importing react from cdn links is a costly operation as it calls some server unpkg and also if we import react from cdn links, it has version attached to it.
If there is any version upgrade of react we have to change the link again. So, it is better to install react package instead of importing react from cdn links.

** What is type="module" while importing App.js to index.html?
type = "module" says its not normal browser script and it is considered as module.

** What is use of mentioning browswerslist in package.json?
By default our app is compatible to run on all browsers. We put browserslist just to tell on what browsers our app should always work. If we put "last 2 versions" that
means app works on all browsers for last 2 versions.

** What is dist and .parcel-cache folders?
dist basically has minification code which is done by parcel. .parcel-cache contains all build versions.
